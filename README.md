# Overview
This is my professional profile page as hosted on Github. You can see it here: https://frank-engel.github.io/

The page is based on this page developed by Mark Macneil. Check it out [here](https://github.com/mmacneil/devfolio). 

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies from your terminal by running `npm install` from the project folder root containing `package.json`.
```bash
$ src\> npm install
```

2. Use webpack to compile and bundle the css/js by running `npm run build` from the project folder root containing `webpack.config.js`.  Webpack will also begin watching these files for changes and re-build as they're modified.

```bash
$ src\>npm run build
```

3. Open `index.html` locally in your favorite browser.
